[NOTE]
====
Why intermediate `TMP` state?

Current _1.1.1.RELEASE_ has a bug which is causing some trouble with
transitions which goes to transient states like _junctions_ and end up
back to same source via anonymous transitions. These are already fixed
in _1.2.0.M2_ and _1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT_ versions. At a time of
writing this, it is not yet sure if these can be backported to _1.1.x_
series.

With _1.2.X_ you can draw transition directly from
`AWAITING_CONDITION` to `HAS_ERROR`.
====

In a `StateMachineTests` test `testPauseAfterThreeFailedValidations`
is setting exception into extended state variable _error_ before
machine is started. Having this extended state variable is causing
machine to loop between `AWAITING_CONDITION` and `HAS_ERROR` junction
due to their transitions guard conditions. Eventually when 3 loops has
been executed, transition back to `SAVED` is done and effectively
machine is halted there because transition to `HAS_ERROR` guarded by
`isPausedGuard` denies further transitions.

```
