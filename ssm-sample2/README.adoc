# Model in DB example

This is a very simplified demo of keeping states and transitions in a database.

## build and test

```
$ ./gradlew clean build

```

# execute

```
$ java -jar build/libs/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

(Or run `DemoApplication` within STS as a boot app)

Open browser with address `http://localhost:8080/`. Every request will build a new machine.

On default states and transitions are populated as
```
statesRepository.save(new States("S1", true));
statesRepository.save(new States("S2"));
statesRepository.save(new States("S3"));
transitionsRepository.save(new Transitions("S1", "S2", "E1"));
transitionsRepository.save(new Transitions("S2", "S3", "E2"));
```

Which can be modified by using embedded `h2-console`.
